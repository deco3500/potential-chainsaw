          <p>Engage with current affairs through the multi-faceted lens of society.<br> Debate on topics from (and agaisnt) a variety of viewpoints. <br>Discover and develop your own understanding.<br> Engage well, and rise above the single minded bias of standard media. </p>
          <p>Union is a focused news aggregation project with the intent to create a community-driven discussion platform. Every few days, a new topic or event will be posted on the page with three articles on the issue displayed. Engage with others on the issue, sway or be swayed, and vote for which article you think best represents the topic.  </p>

          <h1>... See where you stand</h1>
          <p>Using the socio/political matrix your account will develop its own rating as you vote on articles. Any discussion linked to accounts will be coloured based on this rating. You can also vote on posts so valued discussion floats to the top, with unrepresented views weighted more heavily. </p>
          <p>Our article spread as well as the rating and weighting system means that ultimatly, with the platform clear and the field evened, the best community selected discussion will be displayed with all sides represented.  </p>
