# Proposal - Potential Chainsaw

## Introduction
Online news sources are abundant and highly convienient to the average user, but how can someone be sure about the level of bias present in what they are reading?
They cannot, bias is inherent to every work.
Instead we aim to acheive an awareness of bias in all stories and posts consumers read. By presenting articles side-by-side and clearly displaying the alignment of the person/people behind it, we hope to assist users in being conscious of what they are reading and broadly encourage the critical evaluation of media.

## Concept
We will deliver a news source pooling website, which focuses on comparing articles while delivering convienient news. Each day, a single topic will be posted and a number of articles (2-5) on that topic/story will be selected for display. The articles will be taken from all kinds of news sources and rated by a variety of socio/political leanings (using the economic/social progressive/consevative matrix). Complex methods of discussion will be facilitated, including quoting parts of the article, emotional responses, and the ability to build comment threads in various places within an article, as well as a general thread at the end. After 24 hours has passed, the discussion is locked and no further changes can be made.

## User Interaction
Users must register to post/vote but anyone may view.
Accounts may be created from Facebook/Google but display names should be semi-anonymous to encourage open discussion.
Users can up and downvote each article on the topic bsaed upon their agreement with the presentation/language/opinion of the publisher. Users can also rate each others comments that are made on the topic.
User accounts will develop their own matrix rating as they vote/comment/are voted upon which is openly displayed on comments/account pages.
Articles are tagged/coloured/marked based upon what kind of users vote for them.
Comments will be arranged based upon discussion contribution but will only compete with comments from similar matrix ratings (alternativley: only votes from similar ratings will count towards display order/score totals are seperated based on ideology). This allows users to be exposed to a variety of views while still encouraged positive contribution.
