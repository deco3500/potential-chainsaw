Oral pitch in wk6 - Friday 2nd September

Proposal uploaded Monday 5th September

# Proposal - Potential Chainsaw

## Introduction

To add: a way for users to display how an article/comment makes them feel (emotional) without making a text comment.

## Concept
A website. 
Each day, a new topic will be posted and a number (2-5) of articles on that topic/story will be selected for display.
The articles will be taken from popular news sources that represent a variety of socio/political leanings (rated using the economic/social progressive/consevative matrix). 

### User Interaction
Users must register to post/vote but anyone may view.
Accounts may be created from Facebook/Google but display names should be semi-anonymous to encourage open discussion.
Users can up and downvote each article on the topic bsaed upon their agreement with the presentation/language/opinion of the publisher. Users can also rate each others comments that are made on the topic.
User accounts will develop their own matrix rating as they vote/comment/are voted upon which is openly displayed on comments/account pages.
Articles are tagged/coloured/marked based upon what kind of users vote for them.
Comments will be arranged based upon discussion contribution but will only compete with comments from similar matrix ratings (alternativley: only votes from similar ratings will count towards display order/score totals are seperated based on ideology). This allows users to be exposed to a variety of views while still encouraged positive contribution.
