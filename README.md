# Prototype - Potential Chainsaw

## Introduction
Online news sources are abundant and highly convienient to the average user, but how can someone be sure about the level of bias present in what they are reading?

They cannot, bias is inherent to every work.

Instead we aim to acheive an awareness of bias in all stories and posts consumers read. By presenting articles side-by-side and clearly displaying the alignment of the person/people behind it, we hope to assist users in being conscious of what they are reading and broadly encourage the critical evaluation of media.

## Summary
We arent trying to produce the new all encompassing social media craze, more a hot-debate of the day that can brefiley engage users but also allow for extended reading into other viewpoints.

We have delivered a news source pooling website, which focuses on comparing articles while delivering convienient news. Each day, a single topic will be posted and a number of articles (2-5) on that topic/story will be selected for display. The articles will be taken from all kinds of news sources and rated by a variety of socio/political leanings (using the economic/social progressive/consevative matrix). Complex methods of discussion will be facilitated, including quoting parts of the article, emotional responses, and the ability to build comment threads in various places within an article, as well as a general thread at the end. After 24 hours has passed, the discussion is locked and no further changes can be made.

## User Interaction
Users must register to post or vote but anyone may view the articles and discussion. Once registered, they can log in from the login page.

Users can vote on each article by using the matrix based upon their agreement with the presentation, language or opinion of the publisher. Users can also rate each others comments that are made on the topic. Comments can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on them, and users can reply to a comment by clicking on the '@' sign.

Comments are arranged based upon discussion contribution but will only compete with comments from similar matrix ratings. This allows users to be exposed to a variety of views while still encouraged positive contribution.

User accounts will develop their own matrix rating as they vote and comment, which is openly displayed on account pages.
Articles also have a matrix based upon votes from the users.
